                                Hi! I'm Jonathan, but I also go by Jon.
                                I am a 3rd Year <b>MEng Design Engineering</b> student at <b>Imperial College London</b>. 
                                With Engineering knowledge and Design experience, I am an <b>avid ideator</b> and creative who uses <b>human-centered design</b> to solve problems with a focus on the end-user.
                                I am currently <b>looking for a 6-month work placement</b> starting April 2021.
                                Outside of work and studies, I love music, volleyball, and anything with a good story!
                                This website was coded by me using html and css.
                                Check out some of my work below!

                                                        Over the course of the 6 month project, I worked on needfinding, competitor market analysis, ideation, interviewed Mona Minkara, and researched opportunity areas in museums and galleries.

                                                    <p>
                                                        During the ideation phase of the project, I worked on a conceptual handheld device to aid VI users while grocery shopping. <br>
                                                        This included prototyping, and early stage systems design. <br>
                                                        Elements such as being store owned with store built infrastructure were carried over to Explore.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h4>Product Compliance Research</h4>
                                                    <p>
                                                        While developing Explore, I was in charge of reading through what was required by EU and UK Legislation (pre-Brexit), and making sure our product complied. <br>
                                                        This involved referencing BSI and ISO standards and standards Google has used in their Declaration of Conformity for other products, and making amendments to our design. <br>
                                                        By extension, I did the content on the packaging renders and the labels on the device.
                                                    </p>
                                                    <h4>Miscillaneous</h4>
                                                    <p>
                                                        I did the video voiceover, and worked on the conceptual app UI/UX design.

                                                        This project's focal point was designing a hand-held and battery powered tool that not only serves the mass market but also serves the needs of an underserved group. <br>
                                                        We were also required to choose a parent brand that would theoretically be able to expand into our market of interest. We chose Google, and proposed the product line Connect, alongside their existing Nest and Pixel products.

                                    <!-- <h3>The Underserved Group</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Initially unsure of where to begin, we started researching a rather broad underserved group - anyone with difficulty communicating. 
                                        This meant we began looking into issues that foreign language speakers/readers would have, issues regarding the deaf, and finally the blind.
                                        After coming across multiple blind youtubers, as well as discovering the RNIB in the UK and other VI groups, our focus shifted to understanding the needs of the visually impaired.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Molly Burke</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        We read up on the values and goals of organisations working with the visually impaired (Orcam, Vision Foundation, RNIB), and watched some of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwf9TcLyS5KDoLRLjke41Hg">Molly Burke</a>'s videos to understand more about life as a blind person.
                                        From Molly specifically, we learned that navigation in larger areas (a cruise ship, shopping center etc.) was not a big issue with the use of her guide dog. 
                                        However, we observed that in smaller shops and some restaurants where dogs can't be taken and items are more specifically placed, she struggled to navigate more.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Retail Store</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        With this insight, we spoke with a local shop owner about visually impaired customers.
                                        We learned that a new VI customer would not know the layout of the shop and struggle to navigate it, and that not all VI customers respond well to offered assistance.

                                                        During our research we found that most things just inherently aren't designed for a visually impaired person.
                                                        Many everyday objects require or are heavily reliant on visual cues to function, and the current solution - make products specifically for the blind.
                                                        However, these products are very expensive and don't solve the inherent issue of non-inclusive design.

                                                        Currently, under the Equality Act 2010 things such as company policies and shop layouts should accommodate a disabled person, and in the case of a VI person, information should be available in accessible formats such as braille, large print, or email.<a href="https://www.rnib.org.uk/services-we-offer-advice-professionals/equality-act-compliance" style="font-size: 10px;">1</a> <br>
                                                        This is all good, but from watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwf9TcLyS5KDoLRLjke41Hg">Molly Burke</a> and Mona's documentaries, we found that VI users still required assistance from employees to navigate or to find specific items.
                                                        In a voice chat with Mona, she told us she preferred grocery shopping online, because otherwise she would need to phone ahead and make sure someone was available to assist her.

                                                        We found that public transit areas in places like Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan use tactile paving and audio cues to help VI persons navigate independently.
                                                        However, many other indoor locations do not. 
                                                        To find out why, we spoke with <a href="https://www.wongouyang.com/the-team/subheader/danny-t-y-tang/">Danny Tang</a>, who said limitations of indoor tactile strips include aesthetic undesirability for designers and building owners, they often follow unintuitive pathways, and can be tripping hazards to the ambulatory impaired.<br>
                                                        As well as these things, we found that cafes or restaurants and places like museums and galleries with ever-changing layouts would struggle to adopt a permanent solution like tactile paving.

                                                        This system is marketed to museums (and possibly expanding to other indoor locations), and helps museums create a fluid independent experience for VI visitors outside of special VI tours.
                                                        <ul>
                                                            <li>
                                                                BLE (bluetooth low energy) Beacons are placed throughout the museum for indoor positioning information that is fed to the visitor's smartphone. 
                                                            </li>
                                                            <li>
                                                                Upon entry, the VI visitor is given a two-part cane attachment that pairs with the smartphone and detects our "invisible tactile paving" that is laid out in the museum.
                                                            </li>

                                                                The "invisible tactile paving" is easy to place down and easy to remove for the museum for quick layout changes.

                                            <li>Exclusive Design (lack of infrastructural design to support VI users)</li>

                                            An interesting point to note is that the pieces used to generate the region isn't always exactly the same as the 100% filled solution.

                                    <p>
                                        The project was to design an algorithm in Python that would fill as much of a generated polyomino region as fast as possible with the fewest erroneous tiles using tetris pieces.
                                        The possible pieces (as seen in figure 1) used to generate the region are the same as the possible pieces to solve the puzzle. <br>
                                        The algorithm would be assessed by accuracy - where one missing tile and one excess tile is worth the same amount, and how fast the algorithm completed its task. <br><br>
                                        Afterwards I also wrote a recursive backtracking algorithm to fill 100% of the polyomino region with no erroneous tiles using valid tetris pieces. However, this method was very slow and was not scalable.

                                    <p>
                                        In order to test the solution algorithm, ideally there should be a new generated polyomino space for each test.
                                        For this, we were provided with a script that not only generated a new polyomino region with adjustable parameters, but also tracked the running time of the algorithm.
                                        The region is generated as a matrix with (width) columns, and (height) rows, with 1s representing filled tiles, and 0s representing empty tiles.
                                        The solution should be a matrix of the same rows and columns, but with tuples at each point, with the first number representing the shapeID of the piece placed (see figure 1), and the second representing the order in which the pieces were placed.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Corner Pieces</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        Like a regular puzzle, the best place to start is probably at a corner, where there are the fewest possible fitting pieces. <br>
                                        What does this mean? In the case of the puzzle, the corner pieces have the fewest neighbouring pieces.
                                        Applying this logic to the tetriling puzzle, the tiles with the fewest possible fitting tetris pieces will have the fewest neighbouring tiles.
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>The Anatomy of my Solution</h3>
                                    <p>
                                        The algorithm is written as a function, taking the target matrix of the genreated polyomino region as an input.
                                        Within this function, I created the functions neighbour_count, check_piece_validity, check_piece_score, update_neighbour, and place_piece.
                                        When the solution function is run, the dimensions of the target are parsed and an empty solution matrix of the same size is created. 
                                        Afterwards, neighbour_count is called and generates a matrix of the same dimensions as the target, in which all occupied tiles (the 1s) are replaced with a number representing the neighbour count of that tile.
                                        Then, check_piece_validity generates a list of valid pieces for the first occupied tile, check_piece_score ranks the pieces by the sum of the neighbour count of the tiles they occupy, place_piece inserts the piece into the solution matrix, and update_neighbour updates the neighbour count of all neighbouring tiles of the placed piece.
                                        This process is repeated in a loop for each tile, until there are none left.
