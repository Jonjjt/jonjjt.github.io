            <p>
            Explore is a device and system to create an independent museum experience for visually impaired visitors.

            <h2>My Work on the Project</h2>
            <h4>Research and Development</h4>
            <p>
                Over the course of the 6 month project, I worked on needfinding, competitor market analysis, ideation, interviewed Mona Minkara, and researched opportunity areas in museums and galleries.
            </p>
            <h4>Concept Development (Unused)</h4>
            <p>
                During the ideation phase of the project, I worked on a conceptual handheld device to aid VI users while grocery shopping. 
                This included prototyping, and early stage systems design. 
                Elements such as being store owned with store built infrastructure were carried over to Explore.

            <h4>Product Compliance Research</h4>
            <p>
                While developing Explore, I was in charge of reading through what was required by EU and UK Legislation (pre-Brexit), and making sure our product complied. <br>
                This involved referencing BSI and ISO standards and standards Google has used in their Declaration of Conformity for other products, and making amendments to our design. <br>
                By extension, I did the content on the packaging renders and the labels on the device.

            <h4>Miscillaneous</h4>
            <p>
                I did the video voiceover, and worked on the conceptual app UI/UX design. 
            </p>
            <h2>The Project</h2>
            <p>
            This project's focal point was designing a hand-held and battery powered tool that not only serves the mass market but also serves the needs of an underserved group. <br>
            We were also required to choose a parent brand that would theoretically be able to expand into our market of interest. We chose Google, and proposed the product line Connect, alongside their existing Nest and Pixel products.

            <h2>Dr. Mona Minkara</h2>
            <p>
            <a href="https://monaminkara.com" target="_blank">Dr. Mona Minkara</a> is a visually impaired professor of Bioengineering at Northeastern University in Massechusetts.
            With <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUAGEcdoYLOD7x5hTDKmVoA" target="_blank">Planes Trains and Canes</a>, she documents her experiences solo-travelling as a visually impaired person to share the day to day issues visually impaired (VI) people face.<br>
            We met with Mona over skype twice over the course of this project, and kept in touch via email throughout our design process.
            </p>
            <h2>An Exclusive Society</h2>
            <p>
            During our research we found that most things just inherently aren't designed for a visually impaired person.
            Many everyday objects require or are heavily reliant on visual cues to function, and the current solution - make products specifically for the visually impaired.
            However, these products are very expensive and don't solve the inherent issue of non-inclusive design.
            </p>
            <h2>VI Independence</h2>
            <p>
            Currently, under the Equality Act 2010 things such as company policies and shop layouts should accommodate a disabled person, and in the case of a VI person, information should be available in accessible formats such as braille, large print, or email.<a href="https://www.rnib.org.uk/services-we-offer-advice-professionals/equality-act-compliance" style="font-size: 10px;">1</a> <br>
            This is all good, but from watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCwf9TcLyS5KDoLRLjke41Hg" target="_blank">Molly Burke</a> and Mona's documentaries, we found that VI users still required assistance from employees to navigate or to find specific items.
            In a voice chat with Mona, she told us she preferred grocery shopping online, because otherwise she would need to phone ahead and make sure someone was available to assist her.
            </p>
            <h2>Tactile Paving</h2>
            <p>
            We found that public transit areas in places like Hong Kong, Singapore and Japan use tactile paving and audio cues to help VI persons navigate independently.
            However, many other indoor locations do not. 
            To find out why, we spoke with <a href="https://www.wongouyang.com/the-team/subheader/danny-t-y-tang/" target="_blank">Danny Tang</a>, who said limitations of indoor tactile strips include aesthetic undesirability for designers and building owners, they often follow unintuitive pathways, and can be tripping hazards to the ambulatory impaired.<br>
            As well as these things, we found that cafes or restaurants and places like museums and galleries with ever-changing layouts would struggle to adopt a permanent solution like tactile paving.
            </p>
            <h2>Explore</h2>
            <p>
            In order to combat the problems we discovered during our research, we came up with a 3 part system. <br>
            This system is marketed to museums (and possibly expanding to other indoor locations), and helps museums create a fluid independent experience for VI visitors outside of special VI tours.
                <ul>
                    <li>
                    BLE (bluetooth low energy) Beacons are placed throughout the museum for indoor positioning information that is fed to the visitor's smartphone. 
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Upon entry, the VI visitor is given a two-part cane attachment that pairs with the smartphone and detects our "invisible tactile paving" that is laid out in the museum.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    The "invisible tactile paving" is easy to place down and easy to remove for the museum for quick layout changes.
                    </li>
                </ul>
